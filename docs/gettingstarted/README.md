Getting Started with Aviator Core Framework
===========================================

Let's say that your organization has a real problem - there are too many cat people with too many cats.  Everyone talks about Max and Tiger, but everyone's got a Max or a Tiger and now nobody knows which cat is which.  The problem has gotten so bad that management has tasked you with developing a system to keep track of the cats.

Now, you could just whip up an application in Java, but cat people are sketchy and they're not above trying to cheat to get the name they want for their new feline addition.  Disputes happen all the time.  Ah, you say, this sounds like a job for a blockchain!  That way nobody can dispute who the first person was to claim their new kitty's name, and you've got a tamper-proof record to back it up when Karen accusses Robert of stealing her sweet Oliver's name.

The only problem is, you're a Java developer.  You've never built a distributed ledger application before!  You don't know Solidity, and the documentation for Hyperledger Fabric is as thick as a telephone book.

Fortunately, Aviator Core makes it easy for Java developers who don't know much about DLT to build DLT applications.
