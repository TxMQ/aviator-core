## Recap

Let's recap what we've learned in this tutorial:

1.  We learned about Aviator Core Framework and the pipeline programming model for building DApps.
2.  We learned about the Maven dependencies required by the Aviator Core Framework.
2.  We learned about how we map application requirements onto Aviator concepts, such as transaction types and handlers.
2.  We learned how to define the transactions our application supports using `@TransactionTypes` and `@TransactionType` annotations.
3.  We learned about shared application states, and how to create one for our application
4.  We learned how business logic is implemented to handle transaction processing in an Aviator application
4.  We learned how to implement REST API methods that interact with Aviator using the AviatorRestServer library.
5.  We learned how to configure Aviator using aviator-config.json
6.  We learned how easy it is to change the consensus mechanism used by your DApp, and how easy Aviator Core Framework makes it to build applications that leverage Hedera Consensus Services.

## Next Steps
This tutorial describes some of the features available to developers through Aviator Core Framework.  If you want to learn more about Aviator Core Framework capabilities and components, have a look at the [platform documentation](../frameworkdocs/README.md).  You can find the walkthrough code on github at https://github.com/txmq/cats-walkthrough, and a more extensive demo that illustrates additional Aviator Core Framework capabilities like websockets and integration with an Angular web client.

Finally, Aviator Core Framework is an open-source project.  We welcome contributions, feature requests, and bug report submissions through github.

## Thanks!

We appreciate that you've taken time to go through this tutorial and have a look at what Aviator Core Framework can do.
